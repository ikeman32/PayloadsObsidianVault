**Note**: This is the collective work of others from a [GithubRepo](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings) that I decided to convert to an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) Vault. It's still a work in Progress, some links in this About section (Formerly README.md) have beed changed to internal links as they pointed to the original [GithubRepo](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings) area where those files resided. 

For best results reading these files download  [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). There are some files that are not markdown files such as: python, html, txt, etc. I have already converted some of them to markdown but will probably do some more work on them to make them look neater.
