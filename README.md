# PayloadsObsidianVault
This is the collective work of others from a GithubRepo that I decided to convert to an Obsidian Vault. It's still a work in Progress, some links in this About section (Formerly README.md) have beed changed to internal links as they pointed to the original GithubRepo area where those files resided.

For best results reading these files download Obsidian. There are some files that are not markdown files such as: python, html, txt, etc. I have already converted some of them to markdown but will probably do some more work on them to make them look neater.
